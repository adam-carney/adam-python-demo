 Demo Repo for showing work I have done in python
 The code housed here currently is for a project I am working for a MVP of an app and is currently in development. Translation - there is some cleanup and error handling that needs to occur :)
 "backend" - this is the fastapi backend for a frontend that includes pattern matching, upload/download of files to Azure blob storage, and reporting/data visualization and Auth0.
 "mock-data" - this is a proces that will preload and geo-code addresses and create mock data for the application.
